* qnlp 
Let S denote a finite set of symbols (e.g. letters, unicode, ascii etc.), let Wk denote the set of “words” made using k (possibly repeating) symbols from S, and let W=k=1LWk be the set of all words up to length L (described as a disjoint union). Let W denote a particular corpus of words that we’re interested in. Let be a function that maps each symbol to a dd complex matrix and extend it to a function on words by multiplying the matrices associated with each symbol in the word. Finally let there be two positive semidefinite dd complex matrices PL and PR such that (so-called density matrices). Then define a real-valued function q on W so that the following diagram commutes.
